Ambrose"],"publisher":"Simon and Schuster","publishedDate":"2013-04-23","description":"Stephen E. Ambrose’s D-Day is the definitive history of World War II’s most pivotal battle, a day that changed the course of history. D-Day is the epic story of men at the most demanding moment of their lives, when the horrors, complexities, and triumphs of life are laid bare. Distinguished historian Stephen E. Ambrose portrays the faces of courage and heroism, fear and determination—what Eisenhower called “the fury of an aroused democracy”—that shaped the victory of the citizen soldiers whom Hitler had disparaged.Drawing on more than 1,400 interviews with American, British, Canadian, French, and German veterans, Ambrose reveals how the original plans for the invasion had to be abandoned, and how enlisted men and junior officers acted on their own initiative when they realized that nothing was as they were told it would be. The action begins at midnight, June 5/6, when the first British and American airborne troops jumped into France. It ends at midnight June 6/7. Focusing on those pivotal twenty-four hours, it moves from the level of Supreme Commander to that of a French child, from General Omar Bradley to an American paratrooper, from Field Marshal Montgomery to a German sergeant. Ambrose’s D-Day is the finest account of one of our history’s most important days.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781439126301"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1439126305"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":656,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":23,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.16.16.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=d&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":6.99,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":6.99,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&rdid=book-N3mEH3ozXL0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":6990000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":6990000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/D_Day-sample-epub.acsm?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"D-Day is the epic story of men at the most demanding moment of their lives, when the horrors, complexities, and triumphs of life are laid bare."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"iJTQtUozEz4C","etag":"S/xh/oITs/M","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iJTQtUozEz4C","volumeInfo":{"title":"Tax-exempt status of 4-H organizations authorized to use the 4-H name and emblem","authors":["United States.

Hawkeye Pierce, Radar O’Reilly, Trapper John McIntyre, Sherman Potter, Margaret (Hot Lips) Houlihan, B.J. Hunnicutt, Frank Burns, Charles Emerson Winchester, Max Klinger—these and the many other characters who populated the MASH 4077 used the Korean War as a backdrop to comment on many of the social issues of their day. Using a unique blend of comedy and drama, the show’s first three seasons (1972–1975) focused on the anti-Vietnam War sentiment that consumed much of America. As Vietnam ended, M*A*S*H moved on to concentrate on other contemporary issues—the women’s movement, the rise of the religious right in American politics, the new narcissism that marked the early 1980s, the heightened awareness of underage or excessive alcohol use, and the increased emphasis on family in American life. How the series presented these issues and its success in doing so are the subjects of this critical study. An episode listing—brief plot outline, casts and credits, air dates, and titles—is also provided.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0786417013"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780786417018"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":284,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.2.5.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CMPx-jksa6IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CMPx-jksa6IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CMPx-jksa6IC&pg=PP14&dq=h&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CMPx-jksa6IC&dq=h&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Watching_M_A_S_H_Watching_America.html?hl=&id=CMPx-jksa6IC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/Watching_M_A_S_H_Watching_America-sample-epub.acsm?id=CMPx-jksa6IC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CMPx-jksa6IC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"geared toward rehabilitating the military, M*A*S*<b>H&#39;s</b> early ridicule of army <br>\nbureaucracy was gradually displaced by the portrayal of the M*A*S*<b>H</b> unit as a <br>\ncompetent, caring arm of the United States military.
