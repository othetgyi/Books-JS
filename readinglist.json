Ambrose’s D-Day is the definitive history of World War II’s most pivotal battle, a day that changed the course of history. D-Day is the epic story of men at the most demanding moment of their lives, when the horrors, complexities, and triumphs of life are laid bare. Distinguished historian Stephen E. Ambrose portrays the faces of courage and heroism, fear and determination—what Eisenhower called “the fury of an aroused democracy”—that shaped the victory of the citizen soldiers whom Hitler had disparaged.Drawing on more than 1,400 interviews with American, British, Canadian, French, and German veterans, Ambrose reveals how the original plans for the invasion had to be abandoned, and how enlisted men and junior officers acted on their own initiative when they realized that nothing was as they were told it would be. The action begins at midnight, June 5/6, when the first British and American airborne troops jumped into France. It ends at midnight June 6/7. Focusing on those pivotal twenty-four hours, it moves from the level of Supreme Commander to that of a French child, from General Omar Bradley to an American paratrooper, from Field Marshal Montgomery to a German sergeant. Ambrose’s D-Day is the finest account of one of our history’s most important days.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781439126301"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1439126305"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":656,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":23,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.16.16.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=d&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":6.99,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":6.99,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&rdid=book-N3mEH3ozXL0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":6990000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":6990000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/D_Day-sample-epub.acsm?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"D-Day is the epic story of men at the most demanding moment of their lives, when the horrors, complexities, and triumphs of life are laid bare."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"iJTQtUozEz4C","etag":"S/xh/oITs/M","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iJTQtUozEz4C","volumeInfo":{"title":"Tax-exempt status of 4-H organizations authorized to use the 4-H name and emblem","authors":["United States.

Special attention is given to the central role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in immune regulation and induction of peripheral tolerance, as well as to the relevance of Th17 cells in chronic inflammation. The importance of Treg and Th17 cells is demonstrated in bronchial asthma, atopic eczema, contact dermatitis and delayed-type hypersensitivity. Furthermore, T-cell-mediated regulatory mechanisms in helminthic infections and fungal allergy are discussed. Several chapters are devoted to the therapeutic consequences that these recently discovered T-cell functions may have. Their role as a potential target for specific immunotherapy is evaluated and novel approaches for peripheral tolerance induction and treatment of allergic and asthmatic diseases and inflammation are suggested. Stem cell transplantation as a future therapeutic intervention in regulatory T-cell disorders is also considered. Well edited and up to date, this volume is recommended reading for allergologists, immunologists, dermatologists and any scientist interested in the immunological events regulating allergic inflammation in general and allergic manifestations in different organs.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783805586283"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3805586280"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":225,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.1.0.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X-SzZH9i5_MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X-SzZH9i5_MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X-SzZH9i5_MC&pg=PA1&dq=t&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X-SzZH9i5_MC&dq=t&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/T_Cell_Regulation_in_Allergy_Asthma_and.html?hl=&id=X-SzZH9i5_MC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=X-SzZH9i5_MC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Allergen-specific <b>T</b> cells are assumed to play a key role in the sensitization phase <br>\nand in immunological memory.
