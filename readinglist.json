Yet there has been strikingly little attention to the question of how these dramatic changes in Britain's relationships with the wider world were reflected in British culture. This volume addresses this central issue, arguing that the social and cultural impact of decolonisation had as significant an effect on the imperial centre as on the colonial periphery. Far from being a matter of indifference or resigned acceptance as is often suggested, the fall of the British Empire came as a profound shock to the British national imagination, and resonated widely in British popular culture.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0719060486"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780719060489"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":241,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.0.2.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NTaDnKW64BIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NTaDnKW64BIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NTaDnKW64BIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=end&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NTaDnKW64BIC&dq=end&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/British_Culture_and_the_End_of_Empire.html?hl=&id=NTaDnKW64BIC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NTaDnKW64BIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This volume addresses this central issue, arguing that the social and cultural impact of decolonisation had as significant an effect on the imperial centre as on the colonial periphery."}}]
